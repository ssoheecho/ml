One was the popular girls group, and the other was the unpopular girls group. You may think that I would at least have fitted into the unpopular girls group, but I didn't. They locked me out of their little group and wouldn't even talk to me. They teased me mercelessly and so did the popular girls group. I never got invited to any parties after 2nd grade; I never had any friends. The boys basically ignored me (until 7th grade when THEY were the ones who teased me mercelessly), while they flirted with the other girls. All the other girls would talk about was boys (when they weren't bragging to each other about thier home life). They never let me play with them, and the teacher didn't make them include me. In lunch and recess I would just sit alone or cry alone. In 6th grade one of the kids told the teacher to throw me out the window. The teacher just shook his head. Kids are cruel, and I will never, ever, NEVER forget the torture I endured as a child. Yes, I do think kids are buttheads.\n",
